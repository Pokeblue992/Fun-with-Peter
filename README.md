# Fun-with-Peter
Learn about Peter Griffin in this stupid website.


Fun with Peter is a stupid project I started to learn basic HTML and 90's web design.

It doesn't conform at all to any single existing style that I know of,
especially because it takes 90's design elements but uses modern web features.
